            <h4> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
              <p>
               It was interesting as when time is dedicated solely to you unnaturally everything seems to go out the window and I am stuck with what to say. Though it is definitely interesting as I feel like I am not trying to make the other persons conversation about myself, but instead am completely listening to what they have to say. My partner was the other person, and he felt almost the same way. It was interesting as we laughed when it was over, purely at the fact that on ocassions we don't listen to each other fully in everyday life. Woops!
              </p>

            <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
              <p>
                I think what would work best for me is having a buddy, in which case will most probably be my partner, as he is able to also partake and we can (hopefully) sustain practice together. I would also like to incorporate one midnfulness breath a day! I think this is a great idea, simple and effortless. I'm sure it will also help me in those high stress times when I need to appreciate the beauty of everything.
