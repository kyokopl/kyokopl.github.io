      <h3>Analogy for HTML, CSS, DOM - How would you describe it?</h3>
        <p>I enjoy interior design, and even home shows on tv, so this how I would explain HTML, CSS and the DOM.</p>
            <p>HTML - Is the living room, a bare room structure that doesn’t quite feel homely, just as the plain text of html is basic and doesn’t stand out on a webpage.</p>
            <p>CSS- Is where we incorporate the design elements of, wallpaper, light fixtures, curtains, carpets and furniture we choose. Just like CSS is applied to change the style and layout of our webpage.</p>
            <p>DOM - Is the design or vision board that shows what colours and styles are to be used, and where these will be applied, along with any additional touches such as, personal art pieces on the wall.</p>
      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
        <p>The entire webpage is a box, which can be divided into smaller boxes within each other. boxifying is to box up all elements on the page, such as the title, an image and text descirption. This makes it easier to manage and alter when needed.</p>
      <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
        <p>The box model is slightly different. It consists of the margin, border, padding and content which can be tweaked for all our boxes to create different and beautiful styles and effects. </p>
