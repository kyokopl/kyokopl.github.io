            <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
              <p>
                At first, seeing the tasks were to redesing my site, I instantly thought about the endless amount of elements I wanted to include, and how it was going to look, and which colour or style. Though with this instruction, I could see the importance of timeboxing as it took me such a long time to complete the navigation bar itself. If I were to implement everything, I would spend hours on end on my site. I also saw the importance of structuring the page first as we all know this is very important for more efficient development. Although I can see why, it is very hard not completing the total style and feel as seeing it unfinished is like having that itch in your back that you can't scratch :)

            <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
              <p>
                Instantly my mind thinks, quite time, yoga, a peaceful state, and dare I say it, at times boring.             
              </p>
            <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
              <p>
                I loved reading this chapter as it shifted my mindset from the above, to understand it has a lot to do with attention and meta-attention (great bicycle analogy by the way). I always find this topic interesting as I can tend to procrastinate. I couldn't agree more that happiness is just 'being.' When your mind is at ease and clear, this is happiness, it is the default state of mind. The comparison between meditation and exercise resinated with me, and I agree, it is through resistance that one grows!
              </p>
            <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
              <p>
                Yes! The concept of experience without reaction and judging. This is definitely something I need to manage, as I often forget about lingin the experience itself and am in such a rush, or feel the need to judge different interactions, or everything can easily go out the window with my reactions.
