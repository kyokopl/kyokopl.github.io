              <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
              <p>
                In my last job, my line manager had always demonstrated to me compasionate leadership. As many would delegate and micro-manage, she would ensure she took the time to bring herself into our role, and work together to to solve issues, and encourage development.

            <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
              <p>
                Quite interestingly I managed to do this meditation during a time of high stress at home today, it was brilliant. I was able to think of the goodness in myself and others, and bring my mind back to ease.
              </p>

            <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
              <p>
                I felt as though this could be a good practice for when I am experiencing anxiety or nerves, which happens often. Something I am trying to work on.
              </p>

            <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>
              <p>
              <strong>Status</strong> I think status applies heavily especially in the phase 0 experience and I assume will so in the first instance of bootcamp. This is because I am aware that I am completely new to web development, and have the idea in my mind that I may let others down, or come across as incompetent purely because I feel like I have not reached a mastery level yet. I know this is silly, as I am yet to gain more and more experience and practice, and many I'm sure are in a similar boat.
              <strong>Certainty</strong> This definitely applied a few nights ago, where my calculator was not quite working the way I intended. I finished up an incomplete calculator around midnight, and had the most restless sleep. The next morning I had the need to instantly try and resolve it as It occupied what felt like all of my brain capacity.
              <strong>Autonomy</strong> I am yet to think of a way this could apply, though I am sure it does.
              <strong>Relatedness</strong> I don't believe this was hugely apparent in my phase 0 experience, though am looking forward to physucally meet each member of my cohort and work together. I do have the doubt in mym mind that they are all on a completely other level than I am, and hoping this will not be a barrier for social connectedness.
              <strong>Fairness</strong> This is a interesting concept as fairness is often perceived as universal (ie, something is either black or white). Though everyone has a different view of fairness, and this is an eye opener, especially as bootcamp approaches and we will be working alongside others, this is something we must be aware of in order to work together.   
            </p>
              Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h4>
              <p>
                I have probably had many difficult conversations, nothing recently, though I can remember most are difficult for the fact that conflict could arise if not done properly, or it could cause a sense of awkwardness.
