      <h1>Cultural Reflections</h1>
      <h2>15 May 2018</h2>
      
      <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
        <p>A huge emphasis on team work, collaboration, networking, and building life long learners. Completely different to what I though when I first heard about EDA. Having thought that it will be a hugely technical based experience, I am delighted to learn more about the culture EDA is creating, in that it is a place for all to feel comfortable, safe and supported in our endeavours to learn web developement.</p>
      <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
        <p>My impressions are that EDA is promoting a culture of unity for within our cohort and working environment. A safe haven for all to collaborate together, and a supportive environment.</p>
      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
        <p>I absolutely love this! Through both life and work experience I have worked with and met many diverse people. As I am starting web development from scratch, I love the idea that I can express how I am feeling, and any problems that may arise, in the hopes that I will be supported through the teaching staff and my cohort.</p>
      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
        <p>Not at all. I think however, I am going into Phase-0 with a bit more confidence in the fact that I do not need to know everything, but to do my best. I am already loving the sprint I am working on and hoping this will continue further down the track.</p>
      <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
        <p>I am very excited. As with anything new I am a little nervous, not in terms of the environment but more that I don't have a background in web development or coding. Though watching shreefs Fireside Chat has put my mind at ease.</p>
