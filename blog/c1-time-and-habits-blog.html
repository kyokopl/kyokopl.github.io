      <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
      <h2>19 May 2018</h2>

      <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
        <p>I have previously tried the pomodoro technique with university assignments.</p>
      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
        <p>The Fogg technique was quite interesting to me as it was one which doesn't resonate with me at all. The first step is based on being quite specific in defining what behavioural outcome you would like, though specificity at times can be quite difficult to me.</p>
      <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
        <p>The pomodoro technique did seem to work for me as I was also working a few days a week, working out everyday, and by 2.45pm would be my final timer as I needed to pick up my son. I also found this technique helpful when I had a bit of a writers block, it forced me to focus on the task at hand and block out all distractions.</p>
      <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
        <p>The habits of successful people was very interesting to me, in particular the fixed mindset vs growth mindset blog. I found this very helpful as I have struggled with confidence at times in terms of thinking I am unable to do something. The notion of being able to display your ability, and then the confidence will come is great. To apply this to the course, I want to learn as much as I can so I am able to confidently work through tasks. </p>
