            <h4> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
              <p>
               I haven't quite paid attention to what these could be, but in reflection, I know I do tend to get worked up over a few small issues. Firstly, a small thing that has happened multiple times during sprints has been the accidental typo such as forgetting a comma, or spelling a word incorrectly which has let me to go around in circles through my code, chopping and changing to no avail. In my mind I get frustrated and start to think of all the time I am wasting trying to figure this out. When I figure it out, I feel like kicking myself. Almost everytime though, once I've solved it, i turn off the computer and finish for the day, I feel like this is good to get a breather, clear my head, otherwise I could start to make more mistakes in frustration. However, this also gets me as I am on a tight schedule in terms of bootcamp approaching fast. Secondly, when I come across a concept, or block of code I can't seem to wrap my head around it leads me down a path of "can I do this course?, is this right for me?" and so on. With a bit of googling, and help from my sister, it is cleared up, though there are still some concepts that I find confusing, and am hoping in due time I work through these. I have a fear of not being up to everyone elses level, this is not a debilitating fear, though it is always in the back of my mind, and arises in these situations.

            <h4>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
              <p>
                Although not have attempted this exercise myself, I do believe I incorporate most steps in these situations anyway (not knowing it was a technique). I love the idea of the sacred pause as I when I am in these situations i try my best to stop and breathe. Approached I took in the triggers above which has allowed me to find the small typos, however I tend to carry on without reflection and response.
