        <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
            <p>This is a framework consisting of rows and columns that I believe makes you code a lot cleaner to read and manage. This splits your web page into grids to enclose different elements as you wish, making the page look much more beautiful.</p>
        <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
            <p>Responsive webpages are great! Through the use of code rules, you are able to maniplate the webpage depending on the type of device or size of screen used to view the page. It is very popular as there is an ever ending development of new devices, thus web pages must keep up with catering to them.</p>
        <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
            <p>Semantic sturcture is the way in which HTML is written so the user and browser can read it. It is structuring the content of a web page using HTML tags such as Header, Footer etc establishing order on the page.</p>
