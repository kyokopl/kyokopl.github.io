            <h4> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
              <p>
               They are the same. Having self awareness means you must also have mindfulness. They are both the ability to stay grounded when emotions can get high.
              </p>

            <h4>Self awareness practice, <strong>Body Scan</strong>. What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
              <p>
                I felt great, I noticed I was able to forget about a lot of the small things I was thinking about at the time. It was also quite interesting how long 1 or 2 minutes could be. I think this practoce would work best for me, and the next time my emotions are hightened, I definitely want to give it a try.
              </p>

            <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
              <p>
                I took away the concept itself. I have always known my emotions are not me, however, I have never viewed it quite this way before. This being the way we can manage them, as we would a sore arm. I have control over these emotions and there are ways to manage them, such as going for a walk, choosing to not let an emotion take cotrol of me, and who I am.
