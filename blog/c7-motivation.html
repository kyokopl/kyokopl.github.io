            <h4> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
              <p>
               In order for one to experience sustainable happiness, they need to adopt a purpose, passion then pleasure lens. Many often do this in reverse, however we need to establish our own values and higher purpose that we are working towards, in order to develop and experience flow or passion for what we are doing. Thus this will bring about benefits that we can reap as pleasurable.
              </p>

            <h4>What are your core values? <i>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise</i></h4>
              <p>
                My core values that I could think of in the exercise are kindness, reliability, honesty and persistence - these are values I tend to live by.
              </p>

            <h4>What do you stand for? <i>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise</i></h4>
              <p>
                I believe I stand for being ones self! It is so easy in this day and age to get caught up with the do's and dont's, what is in and what isn't, and letting others dictate what you do, how you feel, and how you perceive yourself as worthy etc. One thing that I commonly tell myself is 'be yourself'.
              </p>

            <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
              <p>
               I enjoyed it. Not often do you try to think of all the different ways you have failed, you are more likely to want to block those feelings out and think of happiness and success. Though I can definitely see how it is important to reflect on these in order to be able to work through the emotions experienced through failure. This chapter has definitely resinated with me, and made me realise I need to stop giving myself a hard time about certain things. I am a strong believer that things happen for a reason, so I need to keep bringing myself to this, and have self-belief that all will work out.
