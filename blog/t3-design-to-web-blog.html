                <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Responsive design is a developing your site so that it automatically scales the content to math the device or screen in use. This means images wont become larger than the screen, and it can help avoid resizing, too much scrolling and zooming on pages. It is also much simpler to design as there is no need to design seperate pages for each device, it can now be implemented automatically.It is important as many people are accessing the web from mobile devices, tablets and not purely through desktop. It is also much convenient for many to access it this way. As a result of this websites have to be designed to accomodate for these different sized smaller devices other than a desktop computer.

                <h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mobile first design is where a website is developed from the mobile end, and then further to larger screens and desktops in order for all to be responsive. It is much more restricting than beginning on the desktop site end as the content has to cater to a smaller screen, and then also work well on a bigger screen. It is important as many people are accessing the web from mobile devices, tablets and not purely through desktop. It is also much convenient for many to access it this way.
