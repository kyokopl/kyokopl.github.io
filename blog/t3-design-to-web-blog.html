            <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h4>
              <p>
                Responsive design is a developing your site so that it automatically scales the content to math the device or screen in use. This means images wont become larger than the screen, and it can help avoid resizing, too much scrolling and zooming on pages. It is also much simpler to design as there is no need to design seperate pages for each device, it can now be implemented automatically.It is important as many people are accessing the web from mobile devices, tablets and not purely through desktop. It is also much convenient for many to access it this way. As a result of this websites have to be designed to accomodate for these different sized smaller devices other than a desktop computer.

            <h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h4>
              <p>
                Mobile first design is where a website is developed from the mobile end, and then further to larger screens and desktops in order for all to be responsive. It is much more restricting than beginning on the desktop site end as the content has to cater to a smaller screen, and then also work well on a bigger screen. It is important as many people are accessing the web from mobile devices, tablets and not purely through desktop. It is also much convenient for many to access it this way.

            <h4>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h4>
              <p>
                Frameworks are implemented to make coding easier. I view it in some sense as a ‘shortcut’ as it saves time on coding the common repeated elements in web development. For example, with the use of pre-built functions that are reusable. Thus, this is a pro! It is also free to minimal costs, and has the added support of user information. However, the cons are that it could contribute to surface based learning as you are learning the framework rather than the language of the code itself.

            <h4>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h4>
              <p>
                A wireframe is most commonly a sketch of the layout of content and functions you would like to implement on your site. I see it as a type of storyboard that gives you a starting point for the structure of the site, and then you can later go in ad add it’s more defined features. It is great practice for the development process in order to keep on track of your project.

            <h4>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</h4>
            <p>
              At first I thought the navigation bar would be the toughest part for me as it is quite interactive. Although a lengthy process, it was manageable and I was stoked to have it done. Surprisingly arrangin the images and text through the page was the toughest part, being the alignment, sizing and dimensions. I am yet to have this as I would like, but am continuing to work on it. Lastly, the background colours of the page and the nav bar are a little tricky in terms of getting them to extend as far as I would like. Though, clearly another working point for me.
