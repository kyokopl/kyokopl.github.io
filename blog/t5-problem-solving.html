            <h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem, and how you solved it</h4>
                <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I had a small problem when I was completing 2.5 Paying off technical debt. I was trying create a pull request to merge my tidying branch to the master, and was following all steps correcty, but for some reason it was not working for me at all. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I would go over all the steps, github, tried google, and went over the commend line, I went in circles for some time and decided to begin from the start again. The second time around it worked, I put it down to the fact that I must have done something small that wasn't allowing it to work (typos have gotten me a few times also).
                </p>   

                <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    At first it was fine, I have hit small road blocks before and managed, I did begin to get frustrated slightly as it continuously didn't work, however I didn't quite get to the point where I felt I needed external help. Thinking to myself, just start again, luckily this worked.
                </p>

                <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I learnt that I need to slow down in my steps so I am not missing something small, and not to worry too much as there is most probably always a way to solve the problem. I am however, yet to figure out why the initial ull request did not work.
                </p>

            <h4>Problem solving techniques</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - I find this technique very useful when others are trying to help. It breaks down the code for me, especially if it is quite complex or messy code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Trying something</strong> - I have definitely tried many things before but always have in the back of my mind that I may completely screw something up which could have a big effect! This has not happened yet ;)
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - I am yet to try this technique as I tend to gravitate more to others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - This I have found very helpful in the command line in particular. It is quite tricky to understand the error message itself some times, however I tend to pair it with another technique, i.e google, to help out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Console.logging</strong> - I found this great while I was working through the javascript challenges as a great way to test code. However, I am yet to fully understand how to utilise it with my own code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Googling</strong> - Has definitely been the biggest technique I have used, which I guess is both good and bad. Good in the way it is quick and almost always provides an answer. Bad in terms of relying on it heavily, and possibly getting the wrong information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> - I am yet to stumble across a problem where I have yet to ask peers for help through slack. However, I am lucky enough to have my sister's help who seems to get all the questions I am asking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - Again, I am yet to reach out to the coaches for help, but I am sure it will come soon - esecially with bootcamp approaching.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - I enjoy the process of reflection, especially at the end of each sprint as it helps me identify my strengths and weaknesses so I am able to focus on them a bit more. Otherwise I would probably not pay much attention to why a problem arises, or trying to build skills in a particular area.
