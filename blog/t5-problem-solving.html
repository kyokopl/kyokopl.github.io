            <h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem, and how you solved it</h4>
                <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I had a small problem when I was completing 2.5 Paying off technical debt. I was trying create a pull request to merge my tidying branch to the master, and was following all steps correcty, but for some reason it was not working for me at all. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I would go over all the steps, github, tried google, and went over the commend line, I went in circles for some time and decided to begin from the start again. The second time around it worked, I put it down to the fact that I must have done something small that wasn't allowing it to work (typos have gotten me a few times also).
                </p>   

                <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    At first it was fine, I have hit small road blocks before and managed, I did begin to get frustrated slightly as it continuously didn't work, however I didn't quite get to the point where I felt I needed external help. Thinking to myself, just start again, luckily this worked.
                </p>

                <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I learnt that I need to slow down in my steps so I am not missing something small, and not to worry too much as there is most probably always a way to solve the problem. I am however, yet to figure out why the initial ull request did not work.
