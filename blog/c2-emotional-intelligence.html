      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      <p>
        I took away the importance of the following 5 factors:
        Self-awareness, Self-regulation, Motivation, Empathy, and Social skills. These are all learnt attribute that will enable an individual to really succeed in all aspects of life.

      <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>
        I found it very interesting as it resonated with my son and I at bedtime, often when he wants me to lie down with him until he sleeps, this time is fully encompassed by mindfulness. It also reminded me of a blog I recently read on <a href="https://raisedgood.com/ill-lay-son-fall-asleep-long-needs/">Raised Good</a>. She now seeks solace in this quiet mindfulness as such.
